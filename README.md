This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using the Python turtle module. The game consists of a snake that moves around the screen, consuming food and growing longer. The player controls the snake's direction, and the goal is to maximize the score by eating food without colliding with the snake's own body or the screen borders.

Files

main.py: The main script that initializes the game and handles user input.
snake.py: Contains the Snake class, responsible for managing the snake's behavior, movement, and collision detection.
scoreboard.py: Implements the Scoreboard class to keep track of the player's score and display it on the screen.

How to Play

Run the main.py script to start the game.
Use the arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to control the snake's direction.
The snake will grow longer when it consumes food.
Avoid collisions with the snake's own body and the screen borders.
The game ends when the snake collides, and the final score is displayed.

Features

Snake Class: Manages the snake's segments, movement, and collision detection.
Scoreboard Class: Keeps track of the player's score and high score.
Turtle Graphics: Utilizes the turtle module for a simple graphical interface.
Game Over: Displays a "GAME OVER" message when the snake collides.
